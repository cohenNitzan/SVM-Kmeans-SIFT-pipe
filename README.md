# SVM-Kmeans-SIFT-pipe
Computer Vision project- Implement an E2E pipe with SVM+ K-means + SIFT. The goal was to classify photos into 10 classes (dataset from CalTech101- http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/). The pipe that I chose was SVM + K-means + SIFT. All the code is provided in a .py file. In addition, I provide an English report (PDF).
